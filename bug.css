The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be unexpected behavior if you're not careful with spacing and operator precedence. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width:calc(100%-10px);` might not, due to the missing space between `100%` and the minus sign.  Another common mistake is forgetting to wrap negative values in parentheses within the `calc()` function. For example, `margin: calc(50% - 10px)` is incorrect if you intended a margin that is 10px smaller than 50% of its container's width.  The correct version should be `margin: calc(50% - 10px);`
